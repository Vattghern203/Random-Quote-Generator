# Random Quote Generator ðŸ“–

A simple project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that uses an API to get a random quote every time that the quote button is pressed.

In this project is possible:
- To copy the quote to the clipboard, using the "navigator.clipboard.writeText";
- To hear the quote using a bot, the JavaScript SpeechSynthesisUtterance.
- To share the quote on Twitter, by pressing the Twitter button.
